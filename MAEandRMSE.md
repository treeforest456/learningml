# MAE
* **Mean Absolute Error**: MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It's the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all inividual differences have equal weight.
* If the absolute value is not taken, the average error becomes the Mean Bias Error and is usually intended to meansure average model bias. MBE can convey useful information, but should be interpreted cautiously because positive and negative errors will cancel out.

# Root Mean Squred Error(RMSE): RMSE is a quadratic scoring rule that also measures the average magnitude of the error. It's the squre root of the average of squred differences between prediction and actual observation.
