# MAE
* **Mean Absolute Error**: MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It's the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all inividual differences have equal weight.
* If the absolute value is not taken, the average error becomes the Mean Bias Error and is usually intended to meansure average model bias. MBE can convey useful information, but should be interpreted cautiously because positive and negative errors will cancel out.

# Root Mean Squred Error(RMSE): RMSE is a quadratic scoring rule that also measures the average magnitude of the error. It's the squre root of the average of squred differences between prediction and actual observation.

# MSE
* The MSE is the second moment(about the origin) of the error, and thus incorporates both the variance of the estimator(how widely spread the estimates are from one data sample to another) and its bias(how far off the average estimated value is from the truth).
* For an unbiased estimator, the MSE is the variance of the estimator. Like the variance, MSE has the same units of measurement as the square of the quantity being estimated. In an analogy to standard deviation, taking the squre root of MSE yields the root-mean-squre error or root-mean-squre deviation(RMSE or RMSD), which has the same units as the quantity being estimated; for an unbiased estimator, the RMSE is the squre root of the variance, known as the standard error.
