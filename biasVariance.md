# Bias and Variance
There is not only bias variance trade-off of models, but also bias variance of dataset ( sample ) and crass validation ( sample )
Try to understand this part of the story


## Bias Variance of dataset

## Bias Variance of estimator ( model )
* in random forest and booting models, how adding trees influence the bias and variance

## Bias Variance of Cross Validation
