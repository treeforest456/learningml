* First, ordinary least squares regression makes no assumptions about the dependent variable being normally distributed; it make assumptions about the errors being normal and the errors are estimated by the residuals. However, when the dependent variable is as skewed as yours is, the residuals usually will be too.

* There's no good or bad for skewness. It might violate some of the assumptions of a test.

	- Most people find it difficult to accept the idea of transforming data. Tukey (1977) probably had the  right  idea  when  he  called  data  transformation  calculations  “reexpressions”  rather than “transformations.” A researcher is merely reexpressing what the data have to say in other terms. 
	- You should not get the impression that data transformation should be applied routinely to all your data. As a rule of thumb, 'if it's not broken, don't fix it'.
