## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is also known in the literature as logit regression,
**maximum-entropy classification (MaxEnt)** or the **log-linear classifier**.

In this model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single
trial are modeled using a logistic function.

The implementation in sklearn can fit **binary**, **One-vs-Rest**, or
**multinomial logistic regression** with optional **L2** or **L1** 
regularization.
